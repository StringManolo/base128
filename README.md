# Base128

Use less memory than base64

##### Compatible with Browser and Node.

### Notice 
- I have not found any reference to a "standard" charset, then, this implementation is not compatible with any other base128 implementations. 
- You may want to scape some speacial chars like backticks, single quotes and double quotes. You can do it by appending a replace method before print the result to output.
